Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google.

Need For Container Orchestration Tool?
- Trend from monliths to Microservices
- Increased use of containers
- Demand for a proper way of managing large numbers of containers
- Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and operation of applications, providing a consistent environment across different infrastructure. It automates many manual processes, allowing developers and operators to focus on building and running applications.

Features Of Orchestration Tools
- High avaliabilty or no down time
- Scalability or High Performance
- Disaster Recovery.
- Backup and Restore

Key Kubernetes Concepts:
Containers: Lightweight, portable, and consistent runtime environments.
Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers.
Deployments: Manage the deployment and scaling of applications.
Services: Enable communication between different parts of an application.
